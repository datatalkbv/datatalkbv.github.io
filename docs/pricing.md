# Pricing & Product

## Licensing Plans

Our pricing structure is tiered based on the number of users, down below are the prices per user (excluding VAT) for annual contracts:

- **Up to 10 users**: €299/month
- **10-25 users**: €249/month
- **25+ users**: €229/month

We offer additional discounts for customers who commit to yearly multi-year contracts, as well as those who choose to make upfront payments on a quarterly, bi-annual, or annual basis rather than monthly.

Should you opt to implement our tooling across your entire organization, we are amenable to further collaboration regarding additional discounts and/or fixed pricing models based on fair usage principles. We can establish a fixed company-wide throughput (measured in AI calls per designated time unit) tailored to your needs. This predictable usage pattern enables us to optimize our infrastructure more efficiently, potentially resulting in further cost efficiencies for your organization.

 _De finale keuze was vooral ingegeven door een zeer persoonlijke benadering, dynamische aanpak, menselijke & enthousiaste beleving en snelheid van schakelen. Het eerste resultaat liet dan ook niet lang op zich wachten: binnen een totale doorlooptijd van max 3 maanden hadden we een eerste - relatief complex - project operationeel. Al snel volgden er nog een 5 tal projecten. Dankzij een enorme open mind van Koen en Thomas zijn we vandaag in staat om de bestaande processen zelf te onderhouden._
